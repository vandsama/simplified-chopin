<h2>Sonatas</h2>
<h3>Sonata in music, literally means a piece played as opposed to a cantata (Latin and Italian cantare, "to sing"), a piece sung. (Wikipedia)</h3>
<p>Frédéric Chopin composed three piano sonatas, two of which were published in his lifetime, one posthumously. They are considered to be among Chopin's most difficult piano compositions both musically and technically. They cover a period of time from 1828 to 1844, reflecting Chopin's style changes.
