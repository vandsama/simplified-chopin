<h2>Waltz</h2>
<h3>The waltz, meaning "to roll or revolve" is a ballroom and folk dance, normally in triple, performed primarily in closed position. (Wikipedia)</h3>
<p>Frédéric Chopin’s waltzes are pieces of moderate length adhering to the traditional 3/4 waltz time, but are remarkably different from the earlier Viennese waltzes in that they were not designed for dancing but for concert performance. (Wikipedia)</p>
