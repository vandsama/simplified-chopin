<h2>Impromptus</h2>
<h3>An impromptu is a free-form musical composition with the character of an ex tempore improvisation as if prompted by the spirit of the moment, usually for a solo instrument, such as piano. (Wikipedia)</h3>
<p>Chopin drew on the tradition of the impromptu as an autonomous work. His four impromptus are generally marked by cheerful expression (major keys dominate), devoid of dramatic features. (chopin.nifc.pl)</p>
